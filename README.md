I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills and experiences to new areas and adding value to software development teams. I am always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges, and I am confident that my analytical skills and attention to detail will ensure the quality of software products. If you'd like to connect or learn more about me, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Projects

### Manual testing 
  * As a manual tester for the [Royal Canin e-commerce](https://shop.royalcanin.com/), I performed comprehensive testing on key areas of the website, including login, homepage, product listing and detail pages, user interface, cart, and checkout. Through my testing efforts, I was able to identify and report defects, ensuring that the website was functioning optimally and providing a seamless and error-free shopping experience for customers. My testing methodology adhered to industry-standard testing practices, ensuring the highest quality of testing for the website.
  
### PokeAPI testing
  * As a manual tester, I undertook a personal project to test the PokeAPI, a popular API that provides information about Pokemon. I created a comprehensive test suite consisting of basic requests to the API, covering various endpoints, and then automated the runs. Through my testing efforts, I was able to identify and report issues, ensuring that the API was functioning optimally and providing accurate and reliable information to developers. This project also helped me gain practical experience in API testing, improving my skills and expertise in the field.

### Colabry Encyclopedia (IDforIdeas)
  * As a member of the Quality Assurance team for a collaborative encyclopedia project, I was involved in the end-to-end software development lifecycle (SDLC). I contributed to the planning, design, development, testing, and deployment phases of the project, ensuring that the software was of high quality and met the projects objectives. I collaborated closely with other team members, including developers, project managers, and stakeholders, to identify and prioritize requirements, design test cases, execute tests, and report defects. My efforts helped ensure that the encyclopedia was reliable, functional, and met the needs of its users. This project also provided me with valuable experience in working collaboratively with cross-functional teams and following the SDLC processes.
